        <h1>CoderDojo Tucson Resources</h1>
        <p>
            As we've explored various technologies at CoderDojo Tucson, we've found some resources that have been very 
            useful. Here are a few we'd like to share.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Environments</h2>
        <h3>Scratch</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" alt="Link to the Scratch coding environment and community.">Scratch</a> 
            is one of our favorites. It is a block-based programming environment and community created by the 
            Lifelong Kindergarten group at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology and supported by the Scratch 
            Foundation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With Scratch, we can create music, interactive art, games, and animations. We can share our creations with 
            others in the community and remix projects others have created.
        </p>
        <p>
            We love Scratch!
        </p>
        <h3>Microsoft MakeCode</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode" alt="Link to Microsoft MakeCode programming environment">
            MakeCode</a> from Microsoft is another programming environment we like to use. With MakeCode, we can use 
            code blocks that are much like Scratch or use JavaScript to program micro:bits, hand-held video games, or even 
            robots.
        </p>
        <p>
            One great thing about MakeCode is that we can save projects to GitHub with just a click of a button. 
        </p>
        <h3>Thunkable</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://thunkable.com/" alt="Link to the Thunkable website.">Thunkable</a> is a block-based 
            programming environment that lets us build mobile apps for Android and iOS in the browser - even with 
            Chromebooks!
        </p>
        <h3>replit</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://replit.com/" alt="Link to the replit website.">Replit</a> is a browser-based development 
            environment that supports a wide range of languages, has a free tier for personal use, and runs great on 
            Chromebooks. We've used replit for JavaScript game programming and Python programming.
        </p>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" alt="Link to the Visual Studio Code website.">Visual Studio Code</a>
            is a lightweight code editor from Microsoft with great extension support for many programming languages. 
            We've used it for web programming and Python. This website was programmed in Visual Studio Code!
        </p>
        <h2>Maker Resources</h2>
        <h3>Tinkercad</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" alt="Link to the Tinkercad website.">Tinkercad</a> is a free web-based 
            3D modelling tool that makes it easy to create models to print with a 3D printer. You can even save models 
            in commonly supported file formats for 3D printing (like .OBJ and .STL).
        </p>
        <h3>OpenSCAD</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes you just want to create a 3D model with code. <a href="https://openscad.org/" 
            alt="Link to OpenSCAD website.">OpenSCAD</a> is an open-source 3D modelling language that lets you design, 
            preview, and save 3D model files for printing. The advantage of a tool like OpenSCAD is that you have exact 
            control of every parameter and you can often specify dimensions more accurately and faster than with a 
            graphical modelling tool like Tinkercad.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
        <h3>CodeCombat</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://codecombat.com/" alt="Link to the CodeCombat website.">CodeCombat</a> is a fun way to 
            learn programming in Python or JavaScript by moving through a dungeon, collecting treasure, and defeating 
            monsters with code! While it is necessary to subscribe to unlock all the levels, there are many levels that 
            can be completed for free.
