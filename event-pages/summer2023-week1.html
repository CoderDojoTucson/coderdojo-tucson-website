                    Tuesday, 6 June: Telling a story
                    <p>
                        Story-telling is the ultimate objective of everything from web pages to games, including data collection and visualization. The ultimate goal is to communicate meaning or messages to others. Today, we'll write a story using the hero's journey to explore the basics of story telling.
