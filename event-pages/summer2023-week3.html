        <h1>Virtual Summer Workshop 2023: Week 3</h1>
        <h2>Create your game about water with Scratch</h2>
        <p>
            Scratch is a browser-based development environment that lets you quickly and easily create games using programming blocks. (They're kind of like Legos for code!) By the end of this week, you will have created your own game in Scratch that you can share with others online.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week's workshop is based on the book <span class="italics">Make Your Own Scratch Games!</span>, written by Anna Anthropy and published by No Starch Press. You will get a copy of the book if you attend the workshop! (You can also <a href="https://nostarch.com/scratchgames" alt="Link to the No Starch Press page for the book Make Your Own Scratch Games!">buy the book from No Starch Press</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Scratch-Games-ebook/dp/B07BPLFN37" alt="Link to the Amazon page for the book Make Your Own Scratch Games!">buy it from Amazon</a>).

            Here's a Scratch game created for a <a href="https://watershedmg.org/learn/your-living-lab/family-activities" alt="Family Saturdays web page.">Family Saturday</a> event at Watershed Management Group. Can you remix this game to make it better?

            Here what we'll be doing this week:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Monday, 19 June: Scratch basics
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We'll get started with Scratch by creating a game about a hungry bug eating a leaf
                        </li>
                        <li>    
                            Learn how to use the Scratch editor, how to add sprites and backgrounds, and how to make sprites move
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tuesday, 20 June: Collecting items and avoiding obstacles
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Starting with our hungry bug game, we'll remix it to add multiple items to collect and obstacles to avoid
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We'll also make the game more challenging by increasing the difficulty over time
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We'll end the game by having the bug transform into a butterfly, if the right conditions exist
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wednesday, 21 June: Making a platformer game
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For the rest of the week, we'll build a platformer game, where the player controls a character that can jump and move left and right
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We'll start the game today and add more details tomorrow
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thursday, 22 June: Level design
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            What kind of platform game doesn't have multiple levels?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We'll add some levels to our game today
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>
                            Today is your chance to make your own game!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can start from scratch (pun intended) or remix one of the games we've made this week

                        <li>
