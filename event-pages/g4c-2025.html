                Games for Change (G4C) Learn's flagship program, the G4C Student Challenge, is a game design competition that invites youth to create digital games inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The program uses youth interest in video games to develop coding and digital design skills, as well as problem solving, collaboration, creativity, and other critical STEAM skills. The Challenge is also a platform for amplifying student voices, empowering young people to imagine creative solutions to social problems, and to see themselves as engaged citizens and changemakers. Since its launch in 2015, the Challenge has benefited over tens of thousands of youth, their teachers, and their communities.
