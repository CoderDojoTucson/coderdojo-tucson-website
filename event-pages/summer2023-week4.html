        <h1>Virtual Summer Workshop 2023: Week 4</h1>
        <h2>Explore puzzles of hydrolocalism with Puzzlescript</h2>
        <p>
            Puzzlescript is a browser-based tool that let's you write puzzle games, where you explore areas and solve puzzles by moving objects around. By the end of this week, you will have created your own puzzle in Puzzlescript that you can share with others online.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week's workshop is based on examples created by Anna Anthropy for the book <span class="italics">Make Your Own Puzzlescript Games!</span>, published by No Starch Press.
