        <h2>Week 1: Do your :bit Water Challenge</h2>
        <h3>10-14 June 2024</h3>
        <p>
            We'll take a deep dive (pun intended) into water harvesting basins and you'll have an opportunity by the end of the week to create your own water harvesting project with a micro:bit.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 2: Native Trees and Plants</h2>
        <h3>24-28 June 2024</h3>
        <p>
            Did you know we are surrounded by a bounty of edible foods from the trees and plants native to the Sonoran Desert?
        </p>
        <p>
            This week we'll learn more about our native edible trees in Tucson and then you can use that inspiration to tell others. You can design a game, build an app to map locations of edible trees, animate a story, or whatever else you are inspired to create.
        </p>
        <p>
            You supply the inspiration, we'll provide the support!
