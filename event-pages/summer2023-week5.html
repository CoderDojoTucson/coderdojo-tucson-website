        <p>
            You can't be hydrolocal unless you have a good understanding of the amount of water you can collect and how much water you need. This week, we will collect data about a number of systems at the Living Lab and Learning Center, analyze the data to understand what it is telling us, and use that understanding to tell our local water story.
        </p>
