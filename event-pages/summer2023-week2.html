        <h1>Virtual Summer Workshop 2023: Week 2</h1>
        <h2>Tell your water story with Twine</h2>
        <p>
            You can tell your own interactive story using Twine &mdash; a browser-based tool for creating interactive fiction with minimal coding. By the end of this week, you will be able to create your own water story that you can then share with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week's workshop is based on examples created by Anna Anthropy for the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/twinegames" alt="Link to the Make Your Own Twine Games book webpage."><span class="italics">Make Your Own Twine Games!</span></a>, published by No Starch Press. You will be provided with a copy of the book for the workshop!
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of the types of games we'll be making this week.

            Here is the detailed schedule for this week:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Monday, 12 June: Bitsy and Twine basics
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A quick intro to Bitsy - an alternative to Twine - and creating your first interactive story in Twine
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tuesday, 13 June: Weaving a story with links
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A story with no choices isn't very interesting 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let's use links to let the player make different choices
                        </li>

                </li>

                    Wednesday, 14 June: Adding special effects with scripting
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We're not limited to just displaying a new page of text when clicking on a link
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can also change the appearance of the page with scripting
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can keep track of many things in your game with a variable
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use them to change the story
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Friday, 16 June: Creating your own story

                        <li>
                            At this point you've learned everything you'll need to create your own Twine game
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What story are you going to tell?
                        </li>
