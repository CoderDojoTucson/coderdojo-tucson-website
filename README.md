# coderdojo-tucson-website
A website created for CoderDojo Tucson following (and modifying, where appropriate) the instructions in 
the _CoderDojo <NANO> Create with Code Build Your Own Website_ book by Clyde Hatter, published by the CoderDojo Foundation in 2016. The book is no longer in print, but you can find a Kindle version on Amazon and a print copy from some used book retailers. Supplemental information can be found at the Scholastic website: https://www.scholastic.com/coder-dojo/coderdojo-nano-build-your-own-website-create-with-code/index.html.

You can follow along with the book by looking through the commit history in this GitHub repository (but be aware that the initial commit was a first draft of a website for CoderDojo Tucson that was abandoned in favor of this website - that happens often in coding). Each commit is associated with a badge in the book - for example, the commit labelled **Badge Unlocked: Hello World!** is associated with the first badge in the book.
