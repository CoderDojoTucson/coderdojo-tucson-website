        <p>
            As we've explored various technologies at CoderDojo Tucson, we've found some resources that have been very 
            useful. Here are a few we'd like to share.

                    Snap! is a programming environment created by the University of California at Berkeley. It is a 
                    block-based programming environment like Scratch but has a wide range of blocks for more 
                    advanced topics; like artificial intelligence, data analysis, image processing, machine learning, 
                    mapping, and natural language processing.

                    With MakeCode, we can use code blocks that are much like Scratch or use JavaScript to program 
                    micro:bits, hand-held video games, or even robots.

                <td>
                    One great thing about MakeCode is that we can save projects to GitHub with just a click of a button.

                    Tinkercad is a free web-based 3D modelling tool that makes it easy to create models to print with a 
                    3D printer. You can even save models in commonly supported file formats for 3D printing (like .OBJ 
                    and .STL).
                </td>
                <td>
                    Tinkercad has an intuitive what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface.

                <td>
                    Sometimes you just want to create a 3D model with code. OpenSCAD is an open-source 3D modelling 
                    language and programming environment that lets you design, preview, and save 3D model files for 
                    printing.
                </td>
                <td>
                    The advantage of a tool like OpenSCAD is that you have exact control of every parameter and you can 
                    often specify dimensions more accurately and faster than with a graphical modelling tool like 
                    Tinkercad.
