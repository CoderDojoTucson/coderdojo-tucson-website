        <h1>Virtual Summer Workshop 2023: Week 3</h1>
        <h2>Create your game about water with Scratch</h2>
        <p>
            Scratch is a browser-based development environment that let's you quickly and easily create games programming with blocks. (They're kind of like Legos for code!) By the end of this week, you will have created your own game in Scratch that you can share with others online.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week's workshop is based on examples created by Anna Anthropy for the book <span class="italics">Make Your Own Scratch Games!</span>, published by No Starch Press.
