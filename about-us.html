        <h1>About CoderDojo Tucson</h1>
        <p>
            The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important 
            in the modern world, that it’s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should 
            be denied the opportunity to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            CoderDojo is a global, volunteer-led movement of free, open coding clubs (Dojos) for young people aged 
            7 to 17!
        </p>
        <p>
            At a Dojo, the participants, who we call Ninjas, learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, 
            and games, and explore technology in a fun and creative way. Ninjas also meet like-minded peers, work on 
            exciting team and individual projects, and learn valuable social and transferable skills for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dojos are typically set up by one lead volunteer, known as the champion. The Dojo champion is like the 
            'project manager' of the club. The champion also has a team of volunteers who help them run their club.
        </p>
        <p>
            CoderDojo’s mission is to give young people around the world the opportunity to learn to program computers 
            within a social and safe environment. Because CoderDojo is an open-source movement, anyone anywhere can 
            volunteer to set up a club and each Dojo is unique and operates autonomously. This means every club will 
            differ slightly. However, all verified Dojos are committed to live by the CoderDojo Charter and share the 
            CoderDojo ethos: to be inclusive, free, open, and collaborative.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the founding principles of CoderDojo is ‘One rule, be cool.’ This means, in short, that we should 
            behave kindly towards each other! This applies to Ninjas, parents, guardians, and volunteers.

            CoderDojo Tucson is a dojo of the CoderDojo Foundation.
